# Vulnerability Assessment Report - Metasploitable 2

## Executive Summary
A vulernable Linux host was assessed, revealing extensive exposure of legacy and insecure services. High-risk findings were prioritzied and remdiated, resulting in a substantial reduction of the system's attack surface.

## Scope 
- Single host: Metasploitable 2
- Internal network testing only

## Risk Priooritization Approach
Findings were prioritized based on:
- Remote exploitability
- Authentication requirements
- Availability of public exploits
- Potential for privilege escalation

## Results
| Phase | Open TCp Ports |
| ----- | -------------- |
| Before|     20+        |
| After |     3          |


## Conclusion
The remediation effort successfully transformed a highly vulnerable system into a significantly hardened host, demonstrating practical vulnerability management skills.
